# Waving_Images
An other demo showing 6 different waving bitmaps. The wave affect is NOT done by using different bitmaps, but it uses only the basic bitmap. Then is starts shifting each vertical line of your bitmap up and down.

Because of the way bitmaps need to be converted for use with the screen (and that is vertical), this works vertically but not horizontally.
